The idea behind this repo is to create a very simple programming language used by architects to simplify their work.

The language will also have an official application used for creation of buildings with a preview.

Plans include both 2D and 3D renders and ability to export to AutoCAD.

### Expected Language:
```
  setRender(2D)
  createRoom(width,height)
  goTo(x,y)
  place("car",x,y)
  ```
  
  More soon.
